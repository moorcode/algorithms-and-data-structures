## Calorie Counter

Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, you'll learn how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.

In this practice project, you'll learn basic __regular expressions__, __template literals__, the __addEventListener()__ method, and more.

1. In this project, you'll learn to create a calorie counter form that enables users to input their daily calorie budget and the calorie counts of various meals. The form will then calculate and display whether the user is in a calorie deficit or surplus.

	You have been provided with boilerplate CSS and HTML. However, you need to build your calorie counter form.

	Feel free to explore the HTML and CSS, then add a `form` element and give it an id set to `calorie-counter`.

2. In your form, users will be able to input a number which represents their daily calorie budget. Create a `label` element, give it a `for` attribute set to `budget` and the text `Budget`, then create an `input` element with the `id` set to `budget`.
