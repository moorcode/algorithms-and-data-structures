## Calorie Counter

Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, you'll learn how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.

In this practice project, you'll learn basic __regular expressions__, __template literals__, the __addEventListener()__ method, and more.

1. In this project, you'll learn to create a calorie counter form that enables users to input their daily calorie budget and the calorie counts of various meals. The form will then calculate and display whether the user is in a calorie deficit or surplus.

	You have been provided with boilerplate CSS and HTML. However, you need to build your calorie counter form.

	Feel free to explore the HTML and CSS, then add a `form` element and give it an id set to `calorie-counter`.

2. In your form, users will be able to input a number which represents their daily calorie budget. Create a `label` element, give it a `for` attribute set to `budget` and the text `Budget`, then create an `input` element with the `id` set to `budget`.

3. Your `input` element needs some additional attributes. Give it a `type` set to `number` to only allow numeric inputs, a `min` attribute set to `0` to only allow positive numbers, and a `placeholder` set to `Daily calorie budget`. Finally, mark the `input` element as `required`.

4. In your form, users should have the capability to add various meal types along with their calorie counts. Create a `fieldset` element with the `id` set to `breakfast`. Within that element, create a `legend` with the text `Breakfast`, and an empty `div` with the `class` set to `input-container`.

5. Next, create a `fieldset` element with the `id` set to `lunch`. Within that element, create a `legend` element with the text `Lunch`, and an empty `div` with the `class` set to `input-container`.

6. Continuing the pattern, create a `fieldset` for `dinner` with the same nested elements.

7. You need two more of these `fieldset` code blocks â€“ one for `snacks` and one for `exercise`.

8. When users want to select a meal type to input their calorie counts, they should be presented with a dropdown menu and a button to add the meal type. Start by creating a `div` element and assign it a `class` attribute with the value `controls`. Then, nest a `span` element inside this `div`.

9. In your `span` element, create a `label` element for an `entry-dropdown` and give it the text `Add food or exercise:`. Then create a `select` element with the `id` set to `entry-dropdown` and a `name` set to `options`. Below that, add a `button` element with the `id` set to `add-entry` and the text `Add Entry`.

Give your `button` element a `type` attribute set to `button` to prevent automatic form submission.
