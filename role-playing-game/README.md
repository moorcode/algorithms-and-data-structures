## Role Playing Game

In this practice project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding your own Role Playing Game. You'll learn how to work with __arrays__, __strings__, __objects__, __functions__, __loops__, __if/else statements__, and more.

1. To get started, create your standard HTML boilerplate with a `DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head`, and `body`, then add a `meta` tag for the `charset`. Add a `title` element and use the text `RPG - Dragon Repeller` for it. Include a `link` tag for your stylesheet to link the `styles.css` file.

    Finally, create a `div` element with `id` set to `game` within your `body`.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        <title>RPG - Dragon Repeller</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <div id="game"></div>    
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
