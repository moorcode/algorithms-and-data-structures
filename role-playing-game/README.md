# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Role Playing Game

In this practice project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding your own Role Playing Game. You'll learn how to work with __arrays__, __strings__, __objects__, __functions__, __loops__, __if/else statements__, and more.

1. To get started, create your standard HTML __boilerplate__ with a `DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head`, and `body`, then add a `meta` tag for the `charset`. Add a `title` element and use the text `RPG - Dragon Repeller` for it. Include a `link` tag for your stylesheet to link the `styles.css` file.

    Finally, create a `div` element with `id` set to `game` within your `body`.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
            <title>RPG - Dragon Repeller</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="game">
            </div>    
        </body>
    </html>
    ```
2. Now you can start writing your JavaScript. Begin by creating a script element.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
            <title>RPG - Dragon Repeller</title>
    ```
    ```html
    <script>
    </script>
    ```
    ```html
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="game">
            </div>    
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. One of the most powerful tools is your developer console. Depending on your browser, this might be opened by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`. On Mac, you can press `Option + âŒ˜ + C` and select "Console". You can also click the "Console" button above the preview window to see our built-in console.

    The developer console will include errors that are produced by your code, but you can also use it to see values of variables in your code, which is helpful for debugging.

    Add a `console.log("Hello World");` line between your script tags. Then click the "Console" button to open the console. You should see the text `"Hello World"`.

    ```html
    <script>
        console.log("Hello World");
    </script>
    ```

4. Before you start writing your project code, you should move it to its own file to keep things organized. Remove your `console.log("Hello World");` line. Then give your now empty `script` element a `src` attribute set to `./script.js`.

    ```html
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
    ```

5. Add your `console.log("Hello World");` line to your `script.js` file, and see it appear in your console.

6. Remove your console.log("Hello World"); line to begin writing your project code. Use the `let` keyword to declare a variable called `xp` and assign it the value of `0`, a number.

    ```javascript
    let xp = 0;
    ```

7. Initialize another variable called `health` with a value of `100`, and a variable called `gold` with a value of `50`.

    ```javascript
    let xp = 0;
    let health = 100;
    let gold = 50;
    ```

8. Create another variable called `currentWeaponIndex` and set it to `0`.

    ```javascript
    let xp = 0;
    let health = 100;
    let gold = 50;
    let currentWeaponIndex = 0;
    ```

9. Declare a variable called `fighting` but do not initialize it with a value.

    ```javascript
    let xp = 0;
    let health = 100;
    let gold = 50;
    let currentWeaponIndex = 0;
    let fighting;
    ```

10. Declare two more variables named `monsterHealth` and `inventory`. For your `inventory` variable, assign it the value of an array containing the string `'stick'`.

    ```javascript
    let xp = 0;
    let health = 100;
    let gold = 50;
    let currentWeaponIndex = 0;
    let fighting;
    let monsterHealth;
    let inventory = ['stick'];
    ```

11. In your role playing game, users will be able to track their stats, buy weapons, and fight monsters. Before you can continue with the interactive JavaScript portion of the game, you need to first create the HTML elements that will display the game information.

    Create four `div` elements within your `#game` element. Give them the following respective `id` values, in order: `stats`, `controls`, `monsterStats`, and `text`.

    ```html
    <div id="game">
        <div id="stats"></div>
        <div id="controls"></div>
        <div id="monsterStats"></div>
        <div id="text"></div>
    </div>   
    ```

12. Create three `span` elements within your `#stats` element. Give each of them the class `stat`. Then give the first one the text `XP: 0`, the second one the text `Health: 100`, and the third one the text `Gold: 50`.

    ```html
    <div id="stats">
        <span class="stat">XP: 0</span>
        <span class="stat">Health: 100</span>
        <span class="stat">Gold: 50</span>
    </div> 
    ```

13. Wrap the numbers `0`, `100`, and `50` in `span` elements, and wrap those new `span` elements in `strong` elements. Then give your new `span` elements `id` values of `xpText`, `healthText`, and `goldText`, respectively.

    ```html
    <div id="stats">
        <span class="stat">XP: <strong><span id="xpText">0</span></strong></span>
        <span class="stat">Health: <strong><span id="healthText">100</span></strong></span>
        <span class="stat">Gold: <strong><span id="goldText">50</span></strong></span>
    </div> 
    ```

14. For your `#controls` element, create three `button` elements. The first should have the `id` set to `button1`, and the text `Go to store`. The second should have the `id` set to `button2`, and the text `Go to cave`. The third should have the `id` set to `button3`, and the text `Fight dragon`.

    ```html
    <div id="controls">
        <button id="button1">Go to store</button>
        <button id="button2">Go to cave</button>
        <button id="button3">Fight dragon</button>
    </div> 
    ```

15. JavaScript interacts with the HTML using the __Document Object Model__, or __DOM__. The DOM is a tree of objects that represents the HTML. You can access the HTML using the `document` object, which represents your entire HTML document.

    One method for finding specific elements in your HTML is using the `querySelector()` method. The `querySelector()` method takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns the first element that matches that selector. For example, to find the `<h1>` element in your HTML, you would write:
    
    ```javascript
    let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
    ```

    Note that `h1` is a string and matches the CSS selector you would use.

    Create a `button1` variable and use `querySelector()` to assign it your element with the `id` of `button1`. Remember that CSS `id` selectors are prefixed with a `#`.

    ```javascript
    let button1 = document.querySelector('#button1');
    ```

16. We have run into a slight problem. You are trying to query your page for a `button` element, but your `script` tag is in the `head` of your HTML. This means your code runs before the browser has finished reading the HTML, and your `document.querySelector()` will not see the button - because the browser hasn't processed it yet.

    To fix this, move your `script` element out of the `head` element, and place it at the end of your `body` element (just before the closing `</body>` tag.)

17. `button1` is a variable that is not going to be reassigned. If you are not going to assign a new value to a variable, it is best practice to use the `const` keyword to declare it instead of the `let` keyword. This will tell JavaScript to throw an error if you accidentally reassign it.

    Change your `button1` variable to be declared with the `const` keyword.

18. Use `querySelector()` to get the other two `button` elements using their ids: `button2` and `button3`. Store them in variables called `button2` and `button3`. Remember to use `const`.

    ```javascript
    const button1 = document.querySelector('#button1');
    const button2 = document.querySelector('#button2');
    const button3 = document.querySelector('#button3');
    ```

19. Similar to your `#stats` element, your `#monsterStats` element needs two `span` elements. Give them the class `stat` and give the first element the text `Monster Name: ` and the second the text `Health: `. After the text in each, add a `strong` element with an empty nested `span` element. Give the first inner `span` element an `id` of `monsterName` and the second inner `span` element an `id` of `monsterHealth`.

    ```html
    <div id="monsterStats">
        <span class="stat">Monster Name: <strong><span id="monsterName"></span></strong></span>
        <span class="stat">Health: <strong><span id="monsterHealth"></span></strong></span>
    </div>
    ```

20. Give your `#text` element the following text:
    >Welcome to Dragon Repeller. You must defeat the dragon that is preventing people from leaving the town. You are in the town square. Where do you want to go? Use the buttons above.

21. Now we need some quick styling. Start by giving the `body` a `background-color` set to `#0a0a23`.

    ```css
    body {
        background-color: #0a0a23;
    }
    ```

22. Give the #`text` element a `background-color` of `#0a0a23`, a `color` of `#ffffff`, and `10px` of `padding` on all sides.

    ```css
    #text {
        background-color: #0a0a23;
        color: #ffffff;
        padding: 10px;
    }
    ```

23. Give your `#game` a maximum width of `500px` and a maximum height of `400px`. Set the `background-color` to `#ffffff` and the `color` to `#ffffff`. Use margins to center it by setting the top margin to `30px`, bottom margin to `0px`, and the left and right margin to `auto`. Finally, give it `10px` of padding on all four sides.

    ```css
    #game {
        max-width: 500px;
        max-height: 400px;
        background-color: #ffffff;
        color: #ffffff;
        margin: 30px auto 0px;
        padding: 10px;
    }
    ```

24. Using a selector list (`selector1, selector2`) give both your `#controls` and `#stats` elements a `border` of `1px solid #0a0a23`, a `#0a0a23` text color, and `5px` of padding.

    ```css
    #controls, #stats {
        border: 1px solid #0a0a23;
        color: #0a0a23;
        padding: 5px;
    }
    ```

25. Give your `#monsterStats` element the same `border` and `padding` as your `#stats` element. Set its color to `#ffffff` and give it a `#c70d0d` background.

    ```css
    #monsterStats {
        border: 1px solid #0a0a23;
        padding: 5px;
        color: #ffffff;
        background-color: #c70d0d;
    }
    ```

26. For now, hide your `#monsterStats` element with the `display` property. Do not change any of the other styling.

    ```css
    #monsterStats {
        display: none;
        border: 1px solid #0a0a23;
        padding: 5px;
        color: #ffffff;
        background-color: #c70d0d;
    }
    ```

27. Next, give your `.stat` elements a `padding-right` of `10px`.

    ```css
    .stat {
        padding-right: 10px;
    }
    ```

28. Finally, you will need to add some styles for your buttons. Start by setting the `cursor` property to `pointer`. Then set the text `color` to `#0a0a23` and the `background-color` to `#feac32`. Then set the `background-image` property to `linear-gradient(#fecc4c, #ffac33)`. Lastly, set the `border` to `3px solid #feac32`.

    ```css
    button {
        cursor: pointer;
        color: #0a0a23;
        background-color: #feac32;
        background-image: linear-gradient(#fecc4c, #ffac33);
        border: 3px solid #feac32;
    }
    ```

29. Just like you did with the buttons, create variables for the following `ids` and use `querySelector()` to give them the element as a value:

    `text`, `xpText`, `healthText`, `goldText`, `monsterStats`, and `monsterName`.

    Remember to declare these with the `const` keyword, and name the variables to match the `ids`.

    ```javascript
    const text = document.querySelector('#text');
    const xpText = document.querySelector('#xpText');
    const healthText = document.querySelector('#healthText');
    const goldText = document.querySelector('#goldText');
    const monsterStats = document.querySelector('#monsterStats');
    const monsterName = document.querySelector('#monsterName');
    ```

30. Finally, use `querySelector()` to get the `#monsterHealth` element. Because you have already declared a `monsterHealth` variable earlier, you need to use a different variable name for this element. Declare a new variable with the `const` keyword and name it `monsterHealthText`.

    ```javascript
    const monsterHealthText = document.querySelector('#monsterHealth');
    ```

31. Create an empty function named `goStore`.

    ```javascript
    function goStore() {

    }
    ```

32. For now, make your `goStore` function output the message `'Going to store.'` to the console.

    ```javascript
    function goStore() {
        console.log('Going to store.');
    }
    ```

33. Now create a `goCave` function that prints `'Going to cave.'` to the console.

    ```javascript
    function goCave() {
        console.log('Going to cave.');
    }
    ```

34. Now create a `fightDragon` function that prints `'Fighting dragon.'` to the console.

    ```javascript
    function fightDragon() {
        console.log('Fighting dragon.');
    }
    ```

35. Add a single-line comment that says `initialize buttons`.

    ```javascript
    //initialize buttons
    function goStore() {
    console.log('Going to store.');
    }

    function goCave() {
        console.log('Going to cave.');
    }

    function fightDragon() {
        console.log('Fighting dragon.');
    }
    ```

36. `button1` represents your first `button` element. These elements have a special property called `onclick`, which you can use to determine what happens when someone clicks that button. You can access properties in JavaScript a couple of different ways. The first is with __dot notation__. Here is an example of using dot notation to set the `onclick` property of a button to a function reference.

    >button.onclick = myFunction;

    In this example, `button` is the button element, and `myFunction` is a reference to a function. When the button is clicked, `myFunction` will be called. Use dot notation to set the `onclick` property of your `button1` to the function reference of `goStore`. Note that `button1` is already declared, so you don't need to use `let` or `const`.

    ```javascript
    button1.onclick = goStore;
    ```

37. Using the same syntax, set the `onclick` properties of `button2` and `button3` to `goCave` and `fightDragon` respectively. Once you have done that, open your console and try clicking the buttons on your project.

    ```javascript
    button2.onclick = goCave;
    button3.onclick = fightDragon;
    ```

38. The `innerText` property controls the text that appears in an HTML element. For example:
    
    ```html
    <p id="info">Demo content</p> 
    ```
    ```javascript
    const info = document.querySelector("#info"); 
    info.innerText = "Hello World"; 
    ```
    The following example would change the text of the `p` element from `Demo content` to `Hello World`.

    When a player clicks your `Go to store` button, you want to change the buttons and text. Remove the code inside the `goStore` function and add a line that updates the text of `button1` to say `'Buy 10 health (10 gold)'`.

    ```javascript
    function goStore() {
        button1.innerText = 'Buy 10 health (10 gold)';
    }
    ```

39. Now, add a line that updates the text of `button2` to say `'Buy weapon (30 gold)'` and update the text of `button3` to say `'Go to town square'`.

    ```javascript
        function goStore() {
        button1.innerText = 'Buy 10 health (10 gold)';
        button2.innerText = 'Buy weapon (30 gold)';
        button3.innerText = 'Go to town square';
    }
    ```

40. You will also need to update the functions that run when the buttons are clicked again. In your `goStore()` function, update the `onclick` property for each button to run `buyHealth`, `buyWeapon`, and `goTown`, respectively.

    ```javascript
    function goStore() {
        button1.innerText = 'Buy 10 health (10 gold)';
        button2.innerText = 'Buy weapon (30 gold)';
        button3.innerText = 'Go to town square';
        button1.onclick = buyHealth;
        button2.onclick = buyWeapon;
        button3.onclick = goTown;
    }
    ```

41. Now you need to modify your display text. Change the `innerText` property of the text variable to be `'You enter the store.'`.

    ```javascript
    function goStore() {
        button1.innerText = 'Buy 10 health (10 gold)';
        button2.innerText = 'Buy weapon (30 gold)';
        button3.innerText = 'Go to town square';
        button1.onclick = buyHealth;
        button2.onclick = buyWeapon;
        button3.onclick = goTown;
        text.innerText = 'You enter the store.';
    }
    ```

42. Create three new empty functions called `buyHealth`, `buyWeapon`, and `goTown`.

43. Move your `goTown` function above your `goStore` function. Then copy and paste the contents of the `goStore` function into the `goTown` function.

44. In your `goTown` function, change your `button` elements' `innerText` properties to be `'Go to store'`, `'Go to cave'`, and `'Fight dragon'`. Update your `onclick` properties to be `goStore`, `goCave`, and `fightDragon`, respectively. Finally, update `innerText` property of your text to be `'You are in the town square. You see a sign that says Store.'`.

    ```javascript
    function goTown() {
        button1.innerText = 'Go to store';
        button2.innerText = 'Go to cave';
        button3.innerText = 'Fight dragon';
        button1.onclick = goStore;
        button2.onclick = goCave;
        button3.onclick = fightDragon;
        text.innerText = 'You are in the town square. You see a sign that says Store.';
    }
    ```

45. You need to wrap the text `Store` in double quotes. If your string is already wrapped in double quotes, you'll need to escape the quotes around Store. You can escape them with a backslash `\`. Here is an example:
    
    ```javascript
    const escapedString = "Naomi likes to play \"Zelda\" sometimes.";
    ```
    Wrap the text `Store` in double quotes within your `text.innerText` line.

    ```javascript
    text.innerText = 'You are in the town square. You see a sign that says "Store".';
    ```

46. You have repetition in the `goTown` and `goStore` functions. Repetition in your code is a sign that you need another function. In the previous project, you learned how to work with function parameters. Function parameters act as placeholders for values that you pass to the function when you call it.

Create an empty `update` function that takes a parameter called `location`. Place it before your `goTown` function.

47. In your role playing game, you will be able to visit different locations like the store, the cave, and the __town square__. You will need to create a data structure that will hold the different locations.

Use `const` to create a variable called `locations` and assign it an empty array.

48. Before you can begin to build out your `locations` array, you will first need to learn about __objects__. Objects are an important data type in JavaScript. The next few steps will be dedicated to learning about them so you will better understand how to apply them in your project.

    Objects are non primitive data types that store __key-value pairs__. Non primitive data types are mutable data types that are not undefined, null, boolean, number, string, or symbol. Mutable means that the data can be changed after it is created. Here is the basic syntax for an object:

    ```javascript
    {
        key: value
    }
    ```
    You will learn about keys and values in the next few steps. For now, create a `const` variable called `cat` and assign it an empty object `{}`. Below that `cat` variable, add a `console.log(cat)` statement to see the object in the console.

    ```javascript
    const cat = {};
    console.log(cat);
    
    >{}
    ```

49. Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through __properties__. Properties consist of a key and a value. The key is the name of the property, and the value is the data stored in the property. 

    Inside your `cat` object, add a new property. The key should be `name` and the value should be the string `"Whiskers"`. Open up the console to see the updates to your object. For objects, we will use double quotes, though we have been using single quotes for strings.

    ```javascript
    const cat = {
        name: "Whiskers"
    };
    ```

50. If the property name (key) of an object has a space in it, you will need to use single or double quotes around the name. If you tried to write a key that has spaces without the quotes, it would throw an error. Add a new property with a key of `"Number of legs"` and value of `4` to the `cat` object.

    ```javascript
    const cat = {
        name: "Whiskers",
        "Number of legs": 4
    };
    ```

51. There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (`.`) and bracket notation (`[]`), similar to an array. Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time. Update your console statement to access the `name` property of the `cat` object using dot notation.

    ```javascript
    console.log(cat.name);

    >{name: 'Whiskers', Number of legs: 4}
    ```

52. The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation (`[]`). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation. Update your console statement to use bracket notation to access the property `"Number of legs"` of the `cat` object.

    ```javascript
    console.log(cat["Number of legs"]);

    >4
    ```

53. Later on in the curriculum, you will dive deeper into objects. But for now, it is time to apply what you have learned to your role playing game. Start by deleting your `cat` object and console statement.

54. Your `locations` array will hold different locations like the store, the cave, and the town square. Each location will be represented as an object. Inside your `locations` array, add an object. Inside that object add a key called `name` with a value of `"town square"`.

    ```javascript
    const locations = [
        {
            name: "town square"
        }
    ];
    ```

55. Just like array values, object properties are separated by a comma. Add a comma after your `name` property and add a `button text` property with the value of an empty array. Since the property name has a space in it, you will need to surround it with quotes.

    ```javascript
    const locations = [
        {
            name: "town square",
            "button text": []
        }
    ];
    ```

56. Give your empty `button text` array three string elements. Use the three strings being assigned to the button `innerText` properties in the `goTown` function. Remember that array values are separated by commas.

57. Create another property in your object called `button functions`. Give this property an array containing the three functions assigned to the `onclick` properties in the `goTown` function. Remember that these functions are variables, not strings, and should not be wrapped in quotes.

    ```javascript
    const locations = [
        {
            name: "town square",
            "button text": ['Go to store', 'Go to cave', 'Fight dragon'],
            "button functions": [button1.onclick = goStore, button2.onclick = goCave, button3.onclick = fightDragon]
        }
    ];
    ```

58. Add one final property to the object named `text`. Give this property the same string value as the one assigned to `text.innerText` in the `goTown` function.

    ```javascript
    const locations = [
        {
            name: "town square",
            "button text": ['Go to store', 'Go to cave', 'Fight dragon'],
            "button functions": [button1.onclick = goStore, button2.onclick = goCave, button3.onclick = fightDragon],
            text: 'You are in the town square. You see a sign that says "Store".'
        }
    ];
    ```

59. Add a second object to your `locations` array (remember to separate them with a comma). Following the pattern you used in the first object, create the same properties but use the values from the `goStore` function. Set the `name` property to `store`.

    ```javascript
    const locations = [
        {
            name: "town square",
            "button text": ['Go to store', 'Go to cave', 'Fight dragon'],
            "button functions": [button1.onclick = goStore, button2.onclick = goCave, button3.onclick = fightDragon],
            text: 'You are in the town square. You see a sign that says "Store".'
        },
        {
            name: "store",
            "button text": ['Buy 10 health (10 gold)', 'Buy weapon (30 gold)', 'Go to town square'],
            "button functions": [button1.onclick = buyHealth, button2.onclick = buyWeapon, button3.onclick = goTown],
            text: "You enter the store."
        }
    ];
    ```

60. Now you can consolidate some of your code. Start by copying the code from inside the `goTown` function and paste it into your `update` function. Then, remove all the code from inside the `goTown` and `goStore` functions.

61. Instead of assigning the `innerText` and `onclick` properties to specific strings and functions, the `update` function will use data from the `location` that is passed into it. First, that data needs to be passed. Inside the `goTown` function, call the `update` function.

62. Now it is time to use your `update` function. Pass in your `locations` array into the `update` function call.

    ```javascript
    function goTown() {
        update(locations)
    }
    ```

63. The `locations` array contains two locations: the `'town square'` and the `'store'`. Currently you are passing that entire array into the `update` function. Pass in only the first element of the `locations` array by adding `[0]` at the end of the variable. For example: `myFunction(arg[0]);`.

This is called bracket notation. Values in an array are accessed by index. Indices are numerical values and start at 0 - this is called zero-based indexing. `arg[0]` would be the first element in the `arg` array.

    ```javascript
    function goTown() {
        update(locations[0])
    }
    ```

64. Now your `update` function needs to use the argument you pass into it. Inside the `update` function, change the value of the `button1.innerText` assignment to be `location["button text"]`. That way, you use bracket notation to get the `"button text"` property of the `location` object passed into the function.

    ```javascript
    function update (location) {
        button1.innerText = location["button text"];
        button2.innerText = 'Go to cave';
        button3.innerText = 'Fight dragon';
        button1.onclick = goStore;
        button2.onclick = goCave;
        button3.onclick = fightDragon;
        text.innerText = 'You are in the town square. You see a sign that says "Store".';
    }
    ```

65. `location["button text"]` is an array with three elements. Change the `button1.innerText` assignment to be `location["button text"][0]` which represents the first element of the array.

    ```javascript
    function update (location) {
        button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
        button2.innerText = 'Go to cave';
        button3.innerText = 'Fight dragon';
        button1.onclick = goStore;
        button2.onclick = goCave;
        button3.onclick = fightDragon;
        text.innerText = 'You are in the town square. You see a sign that says "Store".';
    }
    ```

66. Now update `button2.innerText` and `button3.innerText` to be assigned the second and third values of the "button text" array, respectively.

    ```javascript
    function update (location) {
        button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
        button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
        button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
        button1.onclick = goStore;
        button2.onclick = goCave;
        button3.onclick = fightDragon;
        text.innerText = 'You are in the town square. You see a sign that says "Store".';
    }
    ```

67. Following the same pattern as you did for the button text, update the three buttons' `onclick` assignments to be the first, second, and third values of the `"button functions"` array.

    ```javascript
    function update (location) {
        button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
        button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
        button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
        button1.onclick = location["button functions"][0];
        button2.onclick = location["button functions"][1];
        button3.onclick = location["button functions"][2];
        text.innerText = 'You are in the town square. You see a sign that says "Store".';
    }
    ```

68. Finally, update the `text.innerText` assignment to equal the text from the `location` object. However, instead of using bracket notation, use dot notation.

    ```javascript
    function update (location) {
        button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
        button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
        button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
        button1.onclick = location["button functions"][0];
        button2.onclick = location["button functions"][1];
        button3.onclick = location["button functions"][2];
        text.innerText = location.text;
    }
    ```

69. Now update your `goStore` function to call the `update` function. Pass the second element of the `locations` array as your argument. To make sure your refactoring is correct, try clicking your first button again. You should see the same changes to your webpage that you saw earlier.

    ```javascript 
    function goStore() {
        update(locations[1]);
    }
    ```

70. Create two more empty functions named `fightSlime` and `fightBeast`. These functions will be used in your upcoming `cave` object.

71. Add a third object to the `locations` array. Give it the same properties as the other two objects.

Set `name` to `"cave"`. Set `button text` to an array with the strings `'Fight slime'`, `'Fight fanged beast'`, and `'Go to town square'`. Set the `"button functions"` to an array with the variables `fightSlime`, `fightBeast`, and `goTown`. Set the text property to `"You enter the cave. You see some monsters."`.

72. Now that you have a `"cave"` location object, update your `goCave` function to call `update` and pass that new `"cave"` location. Remember that this is the third element in your `locations` array. Don't forget to remove your console.log call!

    ```javascript
    function goCave() {
        update(locations[2]);
    }
    ```

73. Now that your `"store"` and `"cave"` locations are complete, you can code the actions the player takes at those locations. Inside the `buyHealth` function, set `gold` equal to `gold - 10`.

74. After the `gold` is updated, add a line to set `health` equal to `health + 10`.

75. There is a shorthand way to add or subtract from a variable called compound assignment. For example, changing `num = num + 5` to compound assignment would look like `num += 5`. Update both lines inside your `buyHealth` function to use compound assignment.

76. Now that you are updating the `gold` and `health` variables, you need to display those new values on the game screen. You have retrieved the `healthText` and `goldText` elements in a prior step. After your assignment lines, assign the `innerText` property of `goldText` to be the variable `gold`. Use the same pattern to update `healthText` with the `health` variable. You can test this by clicking your `"Go to store"` button, followed by your `"Buy Health"` button.

    Note: Your answer should only be two lines of code.

    ```javascript
    function buyHealth() {
        gold -= 10;
        health += 10;
        goldText.innerText = gold;
        healthText.innerText = health;
    }
    ```

77. What if the player doesn't have enough gold to buy health? You should use an `if` statement to check if the player has enough gold to buy health. Start by placing all of the code in your `buyHealth` function inside an `if` statement. For the `if` statement condition, check if `gold` is greater than or equal to `10`.

78. Now when a player tries to buy health, it will only work if they have enough money. If they do not, nothing will happen. Add an `else` statement where you can put code to run if a player does not have enough money.

79. Inside the `else` statement, set `text.innerText` to equal `'You do not have enough gold to buy health.'`.

80. Use `const` to create a `weapons` variable above your `locations` array. Assign it an empty array.

81. Just like your `locations` array, your `weapons` array will hold objects. Add four objects to the `weapons` array, each with two properties: `name` and `power`. The first should have the `name` set to `"stick"` and the `power` set to `5`. The second should be `"dagger"` and `30`. The third, `"claw hammer"` and `50`. The fourth, `"sword"` and `100`.

    ```javascript
    const weapons = [
        {
            name: "stick",
            power: 5

        },
        {
            name: "dagger",
            power: 30

        },
        {
            name: "claw hammer",
            power: 50

        },
        {
            name: "sword",
            power: 100

        }
    ];
    ```

82. Inside your `buyWeapon` function, add an `if` statement to check if `gold` is greater than or equal to `30`.

83. Similar to your `buyHealth` function, set `gold` equal to `30` less than its current value. Make sure this is inside your `if` statement.

84. The value of the `currentWeaponIndex` variable corresponds to an index in the `weapons` array. The player starts with a `"stick"`, since `currentWeaponIndex` starts at 0 and `weapons[0]` is the `"stick"` weapon. In the `buyWeapon` function, use compound assignment to add `1` to `currentWeaponIndex` - the user is buying the next weapon in the `weapons` array.

85. Change your `currentWeaponIndex` assignment to use the increment operator.

86. Now update the `goldText` element to display the new value of `gold`, and update the text element to display `'You now have a new weapon.'`.

    ```javascript
    function buyWeapon() {
        if (gold >= 30) {
            gold -= 30;
            currentWeaponIndex++;
            goldText.innerText = gold;
            text.innerText = 'You now have a new weapon.';
        }
    }
    ```

87. You should tell the player what weapon they bought. In between the two lines you just wrote, use `let` to initialize a new variable called `newWeapon`. Set this to equal `weapons`.

88. Use bracket notation to access an object within the `weapons` array and assign it to your `newWeapon` variable. Place the variable `currentWeaponIndex` within the brackets. When you use a variable in bracket notation, you are accessing the property or index by the value of that variable.

    ```javascript
    function buyWeapon() {
        if (gold >= 30) {
            gold -= 30;
            currentWeaponIndex++;
            goldText.innerText = gold;
            let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex];
            text.innerText = 'You now have a new weapon.';
        }
    }
    ```

89. `weapons[currentWeaponIndex]` is an object. Use dot notation to get the name property of that object.

90. Update the string `'You now have a new weapon.'` to `'You now have a '` followed by the name of the new weapon, and remember to end the sentence with a period.

    ```javascript
    function buyWeapon() {
        if (gold >= 30) {
            gold -= 30;
            currentWeaponIndex++;
            goldText.innerText = gold;
            let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex];
            text.innerText = 'You now have a ' + newWeapon + '.'
        }
    }
    ```

91. Back at the beginning of this project, you created the `inventory` array. Add the `newWeapon` to the end of the `inventory` array using the `push()` method.

    ```javascript
    function buyWeapon() {
        if (gold >= 30) {
            gold -= 30;
            currentWeaponIndex++;
            goldText.innerText = gold;
            let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex];
            text.innerText = 'You now have a ' + newWeapon + '.'
            inventory.push(newWeapon);
        }
    }
    ```

92. Up until now, any time `text.innerText` was updated, the old text was erased. This time, use the `+=` operator to add text to the end of `text.innerText`. Add the string `' In your inventory you have: '` - include the spaces at the beginning and the end.

93. At the end of the second `text.innerText` string you just added, use the concatenation operator to add the contents of inventory to the string.

94. Add an `else` statement to your `buyWeapon` function. In that statement, set `text.innerText` to equal `'You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.'`.

    ```javascript
    function buyWeapon() {
        if (gold >= 30) {
            gold -= 30;
            currentWeaponIndex++;
            goldText.innerText = gold;
            let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
            text.innerText = 'You now have a ' + newWeapon + '.';
            inventory.push(newWeapon);
            text.innerText += ' In your inventory you have: ' + inventory;
        } else {
            text.innerText = 'You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.';
        }
    }
    ```

95. Once a player has the best weapon, they cannot buy another one. Wrap all of the code in your `buyWeapon` function inside another `if` statement. The condition should check if `currentWeaponIndex` is less than `3` - the index of the last weapon.

96. Arrays have a `length` property that returns the number of items in the array. You may want to add new values to the `weapons` array in the future. Change your `if` condition to check if `currentWeaponIndex` is less than the length of the `weapons` array. An example of checking the length of an array myArray would look like myArray.length.

    ```javascript
    function buyWeapon() {
        if (currentWeaponIndex < weapons.length) {
            if (gold >= 30) {
                gold -= 30;
                currentWeaponIndex++;
                goldText.innerText = gold;
                let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
                text.innerText = 'You now have a ' + newWeapon + '.';
                inventory.push(newWeapon);
                text.innerText += ' In your inventory you have: ' + inventory;
            } else {
                text.innerText = 'You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.';
            }
        }
    }
    ```

97. Now it is time to test your `buyWeapon` function. Right now, the `gold` amount is set to `50`. But to properly see the results of your `buyWeapon` function, the amount should be set to something higher. Update the `gold` amount to `250`. To test your `buyWeapon` function, open up the console. Then click on the `"Go to store"` button followed by the `"Buy weapon (30 gold)"` button four times.

    NOTE: The HTML must be updated to reflect this change in your script.js file.

98. When you were testing your function, you should have seen an error message in the console. This error is due to the condition in the `buyWeapon` function. The `currentWeaponIndex` variable is the index of the `weapons` array, but array indexing starts at zero. The index of the last element in an array is one less than the length of the array.

    Change the `if` condition to check `weapons.length - 1`, instead of `weapons.length`. Test out your buyWeapon function again to see the error message disappear.

99. If the player has purchased all of the weapons in the inventory, the player should not be able to purchase any more and a message should be displayed. Add an `else` statement for your outer `if` statement. Inside this new `else` statement, set `text.innerText` to `'You already have the most powerful weapon!'`. Test your `buyWeapon` function again to make sure the message is displayed when the player has the most powerful weapon.

    ```javascript
    function buyWeapon() {
        if (currentWeaponIndex < weapons.length - 1) {
            if (gold >= 30) {
                gold -= 30;
                currentWeaponIndex++;
                goldText.innerText = gold;
                let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
                text.innerText = 'You now have a ' + newWeapon + '.';
                inventory.push(newWeapon);
                text.innerText += ' In your inventory you have: ' + inventory;
            } else {
                text.innerText = 'You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.';
            }
        } else {
            text.innerText = 'You already have the most powerful weapon!';
        }
    }
    ```

100. Now that you are finished testing that portion of the `buyWeapon` function, you can set your `gold` variable back to `50`. Make this change in your HTML also.

101. Once a player has the most powerful weapon, you can give them the ability to sell their old weapons. In the outer `else` statement, set `button2.innerText` to `'Sell weapon for 15 gold'`. Also set `button2.onclick` to the function name `sellWeapon`.

    ```javascript
    function buyWeapon() {
        if (currentWeaponIndex < weapons.length - 1) {
            if (gold >= 30) {
                gold -= 30;
                currentWeaponIndex++;
                goldText.innerText = gold;
                let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
                text.innerText = 'You now have a ' + newWeapon + '.';
                inventory.push(newWeapon);
                text.innerText += ' In your inventory you have: ' + inventory;
            } else {
                text.innerText = 'You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.';
            }
        } else {
            text.innerText = 'You already have the most powerful weapon!';
            button2.innerText = 'Sell weapon for 15 gold';
            button2.onclick = sellWeapon;
        }
    }
    ```
102. Create an empty `sellWeapon` function.

103. Players should not be able to sell their only weapon. Inside the `sellWeapon` function, add an `if` statement with a condition that checks if the length of the `inventory` array is greater than `1`.

104. Inside the `if` statement, set `gold` equal to `15` more than its current value. Also update `goldText.innerText` to the new value.

105. The next step is to create a variable called `currentWeapon`. Use the `let` keyword to create a variable named `currentWeapon`. Don't assign it a value yet.

106. Use the `shift()` method to take the first element from the `inventory` array and assign it to your `currentWeapon` variable.

    ```javascript
    function sellWeapon() {
        if (inventory.length > 1) {
            gold += 15;
            goldText.innerText = gold;
            let currentWeapon ;
            currentWeapon = inventory.shift();
        }
    }
    ```

107. After your `currentWeapon`, use the concatenation operator to set `text.innerText` to the string `'You sold a '`, then currentWeapon, then the string `'.'`.

108. Now use the `+=` operator to add the string `' In your inventory you have: '` and the contents of `inventory` to the `text.innerText`. Make sure to include the space at the beginning and end of the `' In your inventory you have: '` string.

109. Use an `else` statement to run when the `inventory` length is not more than one. Set the `text.innerText` to say `'Don't sell your only weapon!'`.

    ```javascript
    function sellWeapon() {
        if (inventory.length > 1) {
            gold += 15;
            goldText.innerText = gold;
            let currentWeapon ;
            currentWeapon = inventory.shift();
            text.innerText = 'You sold a ' + currentWeapon + '.';
            text.innerText += ' In your inventory you have: ' + inventory;
        } else {
            text.innerText = "Don't sell your only weapon!";
        }
    }
    ```

110. Now you can start the code to fight monsters. To keep your code organized, your `fightDragon` function has been moved for you to be near the other `fight` functions.

Below your `weapons` array, define a `monsters` variable and assign it an array. Set that array to have three objects, each with a `name`, `level`, and `health` properties. The first object's values should be `"slime"`, `2`, and `15`, in order. The second should be `"fanged beast"`, `8`, and `60`. The third should be `"dragon"`, `20`, and `300`.

111. Fighting each type of monster will use similar logic. Create an empty function called `goFight` to manage this logic.

    ```javascript
    function fightSlime() {

    }

    function fightBeast() {

    }

    function fightDragon() {
        console.log('Fighting dragon.');
    }

    function goFight() {

    }
    ```

112. In your `fightSlime` function, set `fighting` equal to `0` - the index of `slime` in the `monsters` array. Remember that you already declared `fighting` earlier in your code, so you do not need `let` or `const` here. On the next line, call the `goFight` function.

113. Following the same pattern as the `fightSlime` function, use that code in the `fightBeast` and `fightDragon` functions. Remember that `beast` is at index `1` and dragon is at index `2`. Also, remove the `console.log` call from your `fightDragon` function.

    ```javascript
    function fightSlime() {
        fighting = 0;
        goFight();
    }

    function fightBeast() {
        fighting = 1;
        goFight();
    }

    function fightDragon() {
        fighting = 2;
        goFight();
    }

    function goFight() {

    }
    ```

114. At the end of your code, create two empty functions named `attack` and `dodge`.

115. Add a new object to the end of the `locations` array, following the same properties as the rest of the objects. Set `name` to `"fight"`, `"button text"` to an array with `"Attack"`, `"Dodge"`, and `"Run"`, `"button functions"` to an array with `attack`, `dodge`, and `goTown`, and `text` to `"You are fighting a monster."`.

116. In the `goFight` function, call your `update` function with the fourth object in `locations` as an argument.

117. Below your `update` call, set the `monsterHealth` to be the health of the current monster. You can get this value by accessing the health property of `monsters[fighting]` with dot notation.

    ```javascript
    function goFight() {
        update(locations[3]);
        monsterHealth = monsters[fighting].health;
    }
    ```

118. By default, the HTML element that shows the monster's stats has been hidden with CSS. When the player clicks the "Fight dragon" button, the monster's stats should be displayed. You can accomplish this by using the style and display properties on the `monsterStats` element. The `style` property is used to access the inline style of an element and the `display` property is used to set the visibility of an element. Here is an example of how to update the display for a paragraph element:

    ```javascript
    const paragraph = document.querySelector('p');
    paragraph.style.display = 'block';
    ```

Display the `monsterStats` element by updating the `display` property of the `style` property to `block`.

    ```javascript
    function goFight() {
        update(locations[3]);
        monsterHealth = monsters[fighting].health;
        monsterStats.style.display = 'block';
    }
    ```

119. Now, you will need to update the text for the current monster's name and health. Start by assigning `monsters[fighting].name` to the `innerText` property of `monsterName`. Then, assign `monsterHealth` to the `innerText` property of `monsterHealthText`.

    ```javascript
    function goFight() {
        update(locations[3]);
        monsterHealth = monsters[fighting].health;
        monsterStats.style.display = 'block';
        monsterName.innerText = monsters[fighting].name;
        monsterHealthText.innerText = monsters[fighting].health;
    }
    ```

120. Now you can build the `attack` function. First, update the text message to say `'The <monster name> attacks.'`, replacing `<monster name>` with the name of the monster. Remember you can use the concatenation operator for this.

121. On a new line, use the addition assignment operator(`+=`), to add the string `' You attack it with your <weapon>.'` to the text value, replacing `<weapon>` with the player's current weapon. Additionally, remember that this line of text starts with a space so it will properly display.

122. Next, set `health` to equal `health` minus the monster's level. Remember you can get this from the `monsters[fighting].level property`.

123. Set `monsterHealth` to `monsterHealth` minus the `power` of the player's current weapon. Remember that you can access the power of the player's current weapon using `weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power`.

    ```javascript
    function attack() {
        text.innerText = 'The ' + monsters[fighting].name + ' attacks.';
        text.innerText += ' You attack it with your ' + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + '.';
        health -= monsters[fighting].level;
        monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power;
    }
    ```

124. The `Math` object in JavaScript contains static properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. One of those is `Math.random()`, which generates a random number from `0` (inclusive) to `1` (exclusive). Another is `Math.floor()`, which rounds a given number down to the nearest integer.

Using these, you can generate a random number within a range. For example, this generates a random number between `1` and `5`: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;`.

Following this pattern, use the addition operator (`+`) to add a random number between `1` and the value of `xp` to your `monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power`.

    ```javascript
    function attack() {
        text.innerText = 'The ' + monsters[fighting].name + ' attacks.';
        text.innerText += ' You attack it with your ' + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + '.';
        health -= monsters[fighting].level;
        monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;;
    }
    ```

125. Update `healthText.innerText` and `monsterHealthText.innerText` to equal `health` and `monsterHealth`.

126. Add an `if` statement to check if `health` is less than or equal to `0`. If it is, call the `lose` function.

127. At the end of your `if` statement, add an `else if` statement to check if `monsterHealth` is less than or equal to `0`. In your `else if`, call the `defeatMonster` function.

    ```javascript
    function attack() {
        text.innerText = 'The ' + monsters[fighting].name + ' attacks.';
        text.innerText += ' You attack it with your ' + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + '.';
        health -= monsters[fighting].level;
        monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;
        healthText.innerText = health;
        monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
        if (health <=0) {
            lose();
        } else if (monsterHealth <=0) {
            defeatMonster()
        }
    }
    ```

128. At the end of your code, create the `defeatMonster` and `lose` functions. Leave them empty for now.

129. Inside the `dodge` function, set `text.innerText` equal to the string `'You dodge the attack from the <monster>'`. Replace `<monster>` with the name of the monster, using the `name` property.

130. In your `defeatMonster` function, set `gold` equal to `gold` plus the monster's level times `6.7`. Remember you can get the monster's level by using `monsters[fighting].level`. Here is an example of setting `num` to `num` plus `5` * `8`: `num += 5 * 8`. Use `Math.floor()` to round the result down.

    ```javascript
    function defeatMonster() {
        gold += Math.floor(monsters[fighting].level * 6.7);
    }
    ```

131. Set `xp` to `xp` plus the monster's level.

132. Now update `goldText` and `xpText` to display the updated values.

133. Finish the `defeatMonster` function by calling the `update` function with `locations[4]` as the argument.

    ```javascript
    function defeatMonster() {
        gold += Math.floor(monsters[fighting].level * 6.7);
        xp += monsters[fighting].level;
        goldText.innerText = gold;
        xpText.innerText = xp;
        update(locations[4]);
    }
    ```

134. Your `locations` array doesn't have a fifth element, so `locations[4]` doesn't work.

    Add a new object at the end of the `locations` array, following the same structure as the other objects. Set `name` to `"kill monster"`, set `"button text"` to an array with three `'Go to town square'` strings, set `"button functions"` to an array with three `goTown` variables, and set `text` to `"The monster screams Arg! as it dies. You gain experience points and find gold."`.

135. The word `"Arg!"` should have quotes around it. Besides escaping quotes, there is another way you can include quotation marks inside a string.

    Change the double quotes around the string `"The monster screams Arg! as it dies. You gain experience points and find gold."` to single quotes `'`, then add double quotes around `"Arg!"`.

136. After a monster is defeated, the monster's stat box should no longer display. On the first line of the `update` function, use `monsterStats.style.display` to change the display value to none.

137. In the `lose` function, call the `update` function and pass in the sixth object of your `locations` array. Note that you haven't created this object just yet.

138. At the end of your code, create a `restart` function. Inside this function, set `xp` to `0`, `health` to `100`, `gold` to `50`, `currentWeaponIndex` to `0`, and set `inventory` to an array with the string `stick`. Also update the `innerText` properties of `goldText`, `healthText`, and `xpText` to their current values. Finally, call the `goTown()` function.

139. In the `locations` array, add another object at the end. Set the `name` property to `"lose"`, set `"button text"` to an array with three `'REPLAY?'` strings, set `"button functions"` to an array with three `restart` variables, and set `text` to `"You die. &#x2620;"`. In a later step, you will update the code for the `&#x2620;` emoticon text to properly display on the page.

140. Back to your `attack` function - inside the `else if` block, create another `if` and `else` statement. If the player is fighting the dragon (`fighting` would be `2`), call the `winGame` function. Move the `defeatMonster()` call to the `else` block.

    For this step, you will need to use the strict equality (`===`) operator to check if `fighting` is equal to `2`.

    ```javascript
    function attack() {
        text.innerText = 'The ' + monsters[fighting].name + ' attacks.';
        text.innerText += ' You attack it with your ' + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + '.';
        health -= monsters[fighting].level;
        monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;
        healthText.innerText = health;
        monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
        if (health <=0) {
            lose();
        } else if (monsterHealth <=0) {
            
        }
    }
    ```

141. In order for the `&#x2620;` emoticon text to properly display on the page, you will need to use the __innerHTML__ property. The `innerHTML` property allows you to access or modify the content inside an HTML element using JavaScript.

    Here is an example of updating the content for this paragraph element using the `innerHTML` property.

    ```html
    <p id="demo">This is a paragraph.</p>
    ```
    ```javascript
    document.querySelector("#demo").innerHTML = 'Hello, innerHTML!';
    ```

    In the `update` function, change `text.innerText` to `text.innerHTML`.

142. After the `lose` function, create a function called `winGame`. Inside the `winGame` function, call the `update` function and pass in `locations[6]`.

143. Add another object in the `locations` array. Everything should be the same as the `lose` object, except the name should be `"win"` and the `text` should be `"You defeat the dragon! YOU WIN THE GAME! &#x1F389;"`.

144. While your game is feature-complete at this stage, there are things you can do to make it more fun and engaging. To get started, you'll give `monsters` a dynamic attack value.

    Inside your `attack` function, change your `health -= monsters[fighting].level;` line to `health -= getMonsterAttackValue(monsters[fighting].level);`. This sets `health` equal to `health` minus the return value of the `getMonsterAttackValue` function, and passes the `level` of the monster as an argument.

145. Below your `attack` function, create an empty function named `getMonsterAttackValue`. It should take `level` as a parameter.

146. The attack of the monster will be based on the monster's `level` and the player's `xp`. In the `getMonsterAttackValue` function, use `const` to create a variable called `hit`. Assign it the equation `(level * 5) - (Math.floor(Math.random() * xp));`.

    This will set the monster's attack to five times their level minus a random number between `0` and the player's `xp`.

147. Log the value of `hit` to the console to use in debugging.

148. Use the `return` keyword to return the value of `hit` at the end of the function.

149. If you play the game in its current state you might notice a bug. If your `xp` is high enough, the `getMonsterAttackValue` function will return a negative number, which will actually add to your total health when fighting a monster! You can fix this issue by using a __ternary operator__ to ensure negative values are not returned.

    The `ternary operator` is a conditional operator and can be used as a one-line `if-else` statement. The syntax is: `condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse`.

    Here is an example of returning a value using an if-else statement and a refactored example using a ternary operator:

    ```javascript
    // if-else statement
    if (score > 0) {
    return score
    } else {
    return default_score
    }

    // ternary operator
    return score > 0 ? score : default_score
    ```

    In `getMonsterAttackValue`, change `return hit` to a ternary operator that returns `hit` if `hit` is greater than `0`, or returns `0` if it is not.

    ```javascript
    function getMonsterAttackValue(level) {
        const hit = (level * 5) - (Math.floor(Math.random() * xp));
        return hit > 0 ? hit : 0;
    }
    ```

150. In your attack function, find the line of code that updates the `monsterHealth` variable and place it within an `if` block with a condition that calls the `isMonsterHit` function.

151. Add an `else` statement to the first `if` statement inside your `attack()` function. In the `else` statement, use the `+=` operator to add the text `' You miss.'` to the end of `text.innerText`.

    ```javascript
    function attack() {
        text.innerText = 'The ' + monsters[fighting].name + ' attacks.';
        text.innerText += ' You attack it with your ' + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + '.';
        health -= getMonsterAttackValue(monsters[fighting].level);
        if (isMonsterHit()) {
            monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;
        } else {
            text.innerText += ' You miss.';
        }
        healthText.innerText = health;
        monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
        if (health <=0) {
            lose();
        } else if (monsterHealth <=0) {
            if (fighting === 2) {
                winGame();
            } else {
                defeatMonster();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

152. Now create the `isMonsterHit` function after your `getMonsterAttackValue` function. This will return a boolean value (true or false) to be used in your `if` statement. Return the result of the comparison `Math.random() > .2`.

153. The player should hit if either `Math.random() > .2` or if the player's health is less than `20`. At the end of your `return` statement, use the __logical OR__ operator `||` and check if `health` is less than `20`.

The logical OR operator will use the first value if it is truthy â€“ that is, anything apart from `NaN`, `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `-0`, `0n`, `""`, and `false`. Otherwise, it will use the second value.

    ```javascript
    function isMonsterHit() {
        return Math.random() > .2 || health < 20;
    }
    ```

154. On every attack, there should be a chance that the player's weapon breaks. At the end of the `attack` function, add an empty `if` statement with the condition `Math.random() <= .1`.

155. Use the `+=` operator to add `' Your <weapon> breaks.'`, with a space in front of `Your`, to the end of `text.innerText`. Replace `<weapon>` with the last item in the inventory array using `inventory.pop()`, which will remove the last item in the array AND return it so it appears in your string.

156. Decrement the value of `currentWeaponIndex` in your `if` statement, after you update the text.

157. We don't want a player's only weapon to break. The logical AND operator checks if two statements are true. Use the logical AND operator `&&` to add a second condition to your `if` statement. The player's weapon should only break if `inventory.length` does not equal (`!==`) one.

    ```javascript
    function attack() {
        text.innerText = 'The ' + monsters[fighting].name + ' attacks.';
        text.innerText += ' You attack it with your ' + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + '.';
        health -= getMonsterAttackValue(monsters[fighting].level);
        if (isMonsterHit()) {
            monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;
        } else {
            text.innerText += ' You miss.';
        }
        healthText.innerText = health;
        monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
        if (health <=0) {
            lose();
        } else if (monsterHealth <=0) {
            if (fighting === 2) {
                winGame();
            } else {
                defeatMonster();
            }
        }
        if (Math.random() <= .1 && inventory.length !== 1) {
            text.innerText += ' Your ' + inventory.pop() + ' breaks.';
            currentWeaponIndex--;
        }
    }
    ```

158. Now you can add a small easter egg (hidden feature) to your game. Create a new function called `easterEgg` which calls the `update` function with `locations[7]` as the argument.

159. Create an empty pick function with a parameter named guess.

160. Create two new functions named `pickTwo` and `pickEight`. Inside each of those, call the `pick()` function and pass either `2` or `8` as the argument depending on the function name.

161. Add another object to your locations array. Set `name` to `"easter egg"`, set `"button text"` to an array with the strings `2`, `8`, and `'Go to town square?'`, set `"button functions"` to an array with the variables `pickTwo`, `pickEight`, and `goTown`, and `text` to `"You find a secret game. Pick a number above. Ten numbers will be randomly chosen between 0 and 10. If the number you choose matches one of the random numbers, you win!"`.

162. Inside `pick`, use `const` to initialize a variable named `numbers` and set it to an empty array.

163. After your `numbers` array, create a `while` loop that runs as long as `numbers.length` is less than `10`.

164. Inside your `while` loop, push a random number between `0` and `10` to the end of the `numbers` array. You can create this random number with `Math.floor(Math.random() * 11)`.

165. After the `while` loop, set `text.innerText` to equal `'You picked <someGuess>. Here are the random numbers:'`. Replace <someGuess> with the guess function parameter.

166. At the end of the string, before the final quote, insert the new line escape character `\n`. This will cause the next part you add to `text.innerText` to appear on a new line.

167. In this step, create a `for` loop where `i` is initialized to `0`, the loop runs as long as `i` is less than `10`, and `i` is incremented by `1` after each iteration using the increment operator `++`.

168. Now you can write the logic to run in the loop. Inside your `for` loop, use the `+=` operator to add to the end of `text.innerText`. Add the number at index `i` of the `numbers` array, using `numbers[i]`. Then add a new line, using the escape sequence you used earlier.

169. The `.includes()` method determines if an array contains an element and will return either true or false. Here is an example of the `.includes()` syntax:

    ```javascript
    const numbersArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    const number = 3

    if (numbersArray.includes(number)) {
    console.log("The number is in the array.")
    }
    ```
    
    After your `for` loop, add an `if` statement to check if the `guess` is in the `numbers` array. You can use the `.includes()` method to check if the array contains the `guess`.

170. Inside the `if` statement, add the string `'Right! You win 20 gold!'` to the end of `text.innerText`. Also, add `20` to the value of `gold` and update the `goldText.innerText`.

171. Now add an `else` statement. Inside, add 'Wrong! You lose 10 health!' to the end of text.innerText. Subtract 10 from health and update healthText.innerText.

172. Since you subtracted health from the player, you need to check if the player's `health` is less than or equal to `0`. If it is, call the `lose` function.

    ```javascript
    function pick(guess) {
        const numbers = [];
        while (numbers.length < 10) {
            numbers.shift(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
        }
        text.innerText = 'You picked ' + guess + '. Here are the random numbers:\n'
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            text.innerText += numbers[i] + '\n'
        }
        if (numbers.includes(guess)) {
            text.innerText += 'Right! You win 20 gold!';
            gold += 20;
            goldText.innerText = gold;
        } else {
            text.innerText += 'Wrong! You lose 10 health!';
            health -= 10;
            healthText.innerText = health;
            if (health <= 0) {
                lose();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

173. Looking at your `"kill monster"` object, `"button functions"` currently has three `goTown` variables. Replace the third one with `easterEgg` - this is how a player will access the hidden feature of the game. Do not change the `"button text"`.

With this, your RPG game is complete! You can now play around - can you defeat the dragon?
